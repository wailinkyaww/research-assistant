### Personal Research Assistant

The product is a personalized AI research assistant that helps users collect, organize and summarize information from the web.

It solves the problem of inefficient online research, where people often browse through dozens of tabs and struggle to extract and organize insights.

The product will allow the users to submit a query, which will trigger an automated pipeline that scrapes data from online sources, filters and analyzes it, and returns the structured summaries.

Targeted at students, researchers, and knowledge workers, the tool uses large language models to generate concise, and context-aware answers. Unlike traditional search engines, it provides unified, high-quality insights instead of scattered results.
